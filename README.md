# Library

With this project, I learned:

- How to create a toggle option. I found an example on code pen and figured out 
how to implement it in my own project.

- How to create a pop-up form using the dialog element. 

- How to create a form placeholder transition. I found an example of code pen and 
implemented it into my own project. 

- How to create a Book Object prototype. 

- The basic principles of javascript prototypes and how to implement it into my own
project.
